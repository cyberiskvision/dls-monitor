Thanks to the acquisition, Eurmoda will enrich its customer base and strengthen an already complete structure of technologies, skills and plants, which offers the full range of materials required by the high fashion segment, through a vertical service and a fully integrated supply chain. The Macuz family will reinvest in the Group and remain actively involved in the operational management of the companies.

            Over the past 25 years, Auro Macuz and his family, have transformed the artisan firm into an industry consisting of 3 companies, with over 160 employees and more than 7000 square metres of premises, while maintaining the initial idea and artisanship with which the company was founded and grew.

            The very high quality of its production is determined by the professionalism of its staff and the constant renewal of its machinery - with pantographs and CNC lathes and state-of-the-art laser engraving and welding machines - without overlooking the passion and attention with which the company supports its clients, starting from an idea or a design up to the delivery of accessories worldwide.

            A.P.E.R.S is a 1901 law association agreed with the Ministry of Justice and authorized by the judicial courts of Aix en Provence and Tarascon. It is developing geographically across the entire extent of these two jurisdictions for the victim support service and within the jurisdiction of the Aix-en-Provence TJ for the judicial activity service.

            The association is responsible for caring for victims in 97 municipalities that make up the 119 municipalities of Bouches-du-RhÃ´ne, or approximately more than 900,000 inhabitants.

            It began operating exclusively with volunteers for the execution of judicial mandates (judicial checks and personality investigations). The necessary professionalization of the workers subsequently led it to hire socio-judicial workers, social workers, victim receptionists and clinical psychologists. In 1991, the victim support service and the criminal mediation service were created. The A.P.E.R.S is authorized by the Ministry of Justice and operates within the jurisdiction of the judicial courts of Aix en Provence (since 1980) and Tarascon (since 1997).

            Helping victims is today one of the priorities of judicial policies. These now give victims a set of rights. The A.P.E.R.S victim assistance service supports all victims of criminal offenses, natural disasters, collective accidents or attacks and all victims of particularly traumatic violent situations.
