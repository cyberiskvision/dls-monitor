If they had that data backed up, that would have already been restored.Taking into account the level of professionalism of the IT crew employeed in the company and the third parties the company has contracts with, restoration would take a minimum of 6 months or perhaps even more.With regard to company claims that no personal data was leaked, that's also not true. That was simply not disclosed yet.In addition to that, the company contacted us in the first days and we offered our help to solve the problem once and for all, but they've decided their money is more important than their clients and simple folk. At the same time we've received information they are taking a lot of cash out of the company for the purposes hardly related to solving the problem for people if you know what we mean.With our help the company infrastucture could be restored in 4-6 hours and everything could get back to normal the same day.The steps the company takes indicate that its management has no value for people and clients, the only things they have value for is money and profit, unfortunately.","content":"sabesp.html","contactUrl":"https://t.me/RHouseNews","views":"495"},{"id":"8c14b8ba00c66668143f78eae33775d0eaf6be00","header":"[DISCLOSED]Universite Paris Sud","url":"https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/","private":"false","published":"NOT YET","revenue":"$45.8 Million ","employees":"522","action":"Encrypted","volume":"1 TB","actionDate":"11/08/2024","status":"DISCLOSED","statusDate":"29/10/2024","info":"The university is a unique network of five faculties, three university technical institutes (IUT), five schools, two associate member universities and seven national research organisations.
